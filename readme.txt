Change the native Wordpress gallery to a gallery that nicely fits your images into a jigsaw-like grid. Much like the Google+ gallery.


== Description ==

If the plugin is activated, all of your Wordpress galleries will be styled like a Google+ gallery.

Main features include:

1. The gallery will fit in nicely in a responsive web design, as the grid is recalculated when scaling the window.
1. By default the images will pop out a whenever you move the cursor over them. The z-indexes are updating so that the pop-out images are always on top.
1. The animation speed, scaling, margins and max row height are customizable in the `[gallery]` shortcode.

A live example can be viewed at http://bdwm.be/rgg/demo/

Documentation available at http://bdwm.be/rgg/shortcode-parameters/

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress Admin
1. You're done!

= Finetuning =

If you want to finetune the options per gallery you can add some parameters to the gallery shortcode (from text editor).

Documentation available at http://bdwm.be/rgg/shortcode-parameters/

More options comming soon! Please start a support thread for any of your requests.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a lightbox to the gallery? =

Any way you would add a lightbox to the native wordpress gallery will work for Responsive Gallery Grid.
One plugin I know that will work right out of the box is jQuery ColorBox. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jquery-colorbox/

Sure. Please start a support thread for any of your requests.

== Upgrade Notice ==

1. Nothing for now

== Screenshots ==

1. Responsive Gallery Grid in action. By default the images will pop out on mouse-over.
2. The gallery shortcode can be extended with some options, from the text editor.
3. From the WYSIWYG view the gallery looks like an ordinary Wordpress gallery, so you can easily add and remove pictures the way you are used to.
